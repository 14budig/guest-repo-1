# Setup

Whenever you receive a new rails project there are a few steps you probably want to perform.  Can you think what those might be?

```sh
bundle install
rake db:setup #or rake db:create db:schema:load
```
> commit these to memory!


This exercise is broken into several pieces on different branches.  You'll be asked to create various migrations for each exercise and you'll be given tests to help you verify your work.

After you complete an exercise, you'll commit and then change branches.  *(your changes on branch A won't show up on branch B)*
